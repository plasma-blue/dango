Dango is an lightweight, atomic canvas for your thoughts.

It doesn't try to be a complex drawing tool or a heavy note-taking app. It is built to catch fragmented ideas the moment inspiration strikes and organize their relationships instantly.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Atomic Nodes**: Transform fragmented text into independent atomic nodes.
- **Efficient Operation**: Optimized for keyboard workflows. Linking, aligning, grouping, and coloring—all logic is simple and direct.
- **Hand-drawn Style**: Built-in hand-drawn font style.
- **Flexible Export**: Share your canvas via compressed **URLs**, or export to local **.dango files** and **SVG vectors**.
- **Safety**: Undo/Redo system and safety snapshots act as a safeguard to ensure no fleeting inspiration is lost.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. Type your ideas in the input box (separated by spaces, commas, or newlines).
2. Click **Create Nodes**.
3. Start arranging, linking, and organizing.
