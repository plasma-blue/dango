Dango is a lightweight, atomic thought-organizing tool born for **efficient block diagramming**.

It doesn't try to be a complex drawing software or a heavy note-taking app. Instead, it helps you quickly organize scattered thoughts and clarify relationships the moment inspiration strikes.

### 🚀 Why Dango?

- **Efficiency First**:
    - **Type-to-Generate**: Batch input your ideas via the input box and transform them into atomic nodes instantly.
    - **Keyboard-Centric**: Designed for a keyboard-first workflow—link, group, and align nodes without frequent mouse switching.
    - **Smart Layout**: One-click intelligent alignment to make messy nodes look professional and organized.
- **Local-First & Private**:
    - **No-Backend Design**: Your data stays strictly in your local browser.
    - **Link-as-Data**: The entire state is encoded into the URL. Sharing a link is sharing the data—no registration, no database required.
    - **Data Safety**: Features a robust Undo/Redo system, multiple export options, and safety nets for destructive operations to ensure your inspiration is never lost.
- **Experience Focused**:
    - **Designed for Flow**: Minimalist and intuitive, allowing you to focus on your thoughts rather than the tool itself.
    - **Deeply Embeddable**: Easily embed Dango into Notion, Obsidian, personal blogs, or anywhere that supports iframes.
    - **Hand-Drawn Aesthetics**: Optional hand-drawn fonts and sketchy borders for a more personal and friendly visual style.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Type Ideas**: Enter phrases in the bottom input box (separated by spaces or Enter).
2. **Generate Nodes**: Click the button or press Enter to scatter nodes on the canvas.
3. **Organize**: Use shortcuts to link, align, and group nodes.
4. **Share/Embed**: Generate a shareable link or get the embed code.
